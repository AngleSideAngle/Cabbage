## single target functions (a -> b)
### cabbage
if the last word person a said was person b's name, person a may be able to cabbage person b depending on what follows.
- if person b says minimuffin, they are safe from being cabbaged
- if person b says anything other than minimuffin/s, person a gets a cabbage opportunity
- if person b says nothing for 10 seconds, person a gets a cabbage opportunity

when person a has a cabbage opportunity, they can say cabbage to person b within 10 seconds of the cabbage opportunity arising and person b will now be cabbaged (that does not imply any status or effects).

### turnip (delay)
- if person a has a cabbage opportunity on person b, but fails to cabbage them within 10 seconds, person b can turnip (say turnip to) person a.

### cabbage (improper use)
- if person a incorrectly uses any cabbage game functions, person b can cabbage them (please specify by saying "cabbage improper use" instead of just "cabbage")


## multiple target functions (anyone -> b)
turnip (repetition)
if person b is repeating the same word, for every:
- multiple of 3
- multiple of 7
the repetitions of that word hit, anyone hearing can say turnip to person b


## notes
### words
- words matter, not letters. for example if a person said "minimuffin minimuffin minimuffins", they could not be turniped since minimuffins is a different word from minimuffin

### multiple targets of single functions
- if there is more than 1 person b in a single target function, the function will apply individually to each person b

### text
- when talking over text, the ability to cabbage someone if they do not respond for 10 seconds is invalid.

### verbal
- when talking in real life, if you say someone's name while they are talking, that name does not count to have been said until after they finish their sentence. (this applies to all rules for the cabbage function such as waiting 10 seconds or someone not saying minimuffin)
- if either person (a or b) does not hear the required words, even if they were said, a function cannot be used.

### names
- first, last name, and nicknames all work to cabbage someone, but you may not cabbage someone under a name they do not use.

### time dilation
- all time, such as 10 second intervals, is measured relative to time experienced on Earth
